# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard that displays current and future weather conditions for any city that is searched.

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API to retrieve current weather and a 5-day forecast. This dashboard also keeps a record of previously searched cities and allows you to clear the search history.
